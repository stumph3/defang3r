# URL Defanger Tool

The URL Defanger Tool is a simple Bash script that processes a text file containing URLs and transforms them to a defanged format. This is particularly useful for cybersecurity and IT professionals who need to share URLs safely without risking accidental hyperlinks, which can be potentially harmful.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that a file is provided as input and that it exists before proceeding.
- **Automatic Output Filenaming**: Generates an output file's name by appending `-defang3d` to the input file's base name.
- **URL Defanging**:
  - Replaces dots `.` with `[dot]`
  - Modifies the protocol `http` to `hxxp` by altering `tt` to `xx`
  
## Usage

To use this script, you must provide it with a single argument: the path to a text file containing URLs you want to defang. Below is the syntax to run the script:

```bash
./url_defanger.sh inputFile.txt
Example
Suppose you have a file named links.txt containing the following URLs:

http://example.com
https://google.com
http://yahoo.com
After running the script:

./url_defanger.sh links.txt
You would find a new file named links-defang3d.txt in the same directory containing:

hxxp://example[dot]com
hxxps://google[dot]com
hxxp://yahoo[dot]com
